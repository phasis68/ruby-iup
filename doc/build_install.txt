Building ruby-iup
====================

Pre-requisites
--------------

General
--------------
* C compiler (not needed for binary install on Windows)
* ruby 1.8.5+ or ruby 1.9.0+
* rake
* rubygems 0.9.1+
* IUP 3.0+ header and library (not needed for binary install on Windows)
* CD 5.3+ header and library  (not needed for binary install on Windows)
* IM 3.6+ header and library  (not needed for binary install on Windows)
  

Linux
--------------
On Ubuntu or Debian systems, aside from Ruby you'll need ruby and
some extra ruby related packages:

* `ruby rdoc ri ruby1.8-dev`

On older Gentoo, Debian and Ubuntu, rubygems 0.9.0 will be installed by default
in the packages.  This version of rubygems is INCOMPATIBLE with ruby-iup.
You'll need to install rubygems 0.9.1+ from source.

On some distributions you may need 'xorg-dev' developer package.



Build and installation
--------------

Installing from rubygems
-------------------

Runnig 'gem install -y ruby-iup' and it should pull down the gem
and try to build the bindings for you automatically.

For windows there is also pre-built binary windows gem available
(i386-mswin32) which is compatible with the ruby one-click installer and does not need
compiler or other mentioned tools installed.

Manual Build instructions for all platforms (see above for platform-specific notes)
------------------
1. Make sure you have working ruby with rubygems installed
	 and (if needed) appropriate developer packages (ruby-dev,ruby1.8-dev,...).
2. Make sure you have working C compiler
3. Install rake either from package or by running 'gem install rake'
4. Run 'rake' at the top level of the project

Installing manually built extensions
------------------
1. Run 'rake clean' to clean out the project
2. Run 'rake gem:create' to create source gem from project
3. Run 'gem install ruby-iup-(version).gem' to compile and install the gem
4. Done.

Building binary gem (useful only for binary distribution of the project)
------------------
1. Run 'rake clean' to clean out the project
2. Run 'rake gem:binary' to build source gem
3. Run 'gem install ruby-iup-(version).gem' to compile the binary gem



Running programs and examples
-----------------
To run a sample file, make sure the ruby-iup gem is installed then:

    $ cd examples
    $ ruby sample.rb

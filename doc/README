ruby-opengl tests
=================

This directory contains the unit tests for ruby-opengl. You should be able
to run the test by calling 'rake test' from installation root directory. 

Note that the tests are meant for purposes of internal development, and depending on
your system configuration may not run at all - the purpose is to test the
bindings, not the underlying OpenGL implementation.
